// This code defines an array of contact information objects, each containing a title, icon, content (which is an array of strings), an image path, and a delay for animations. This data can be used to populate a contact page with various contact methods such as address, phone number, and email. Each object can be rendered in a component to display the contact information dynamically.
// The contactData array can be imported and used in a React component to display contact information dynamically, such as in a Contact Us page. Each object in the array represents a different method of contact, including address, phone number, and email, along with associated icons and images for visual representation.
